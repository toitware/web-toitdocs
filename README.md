# Setup for development

## yarn

`yarn` is used in web projects. To install `yarn`, follow the guide [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable).

Note! You don't need to setup your `PATH` env.var. as described in the guide.

If you haven't installed `node` yet, install `node` from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/). Add the node bin directory to your `PATH` in `$HOME/.profile`

The version of `node` must be >= v12.16.1, i.e. the version of node that comes with yarn is not the latest.

## Linting and imports in VS Code

- Add the ESLint extension to VS Code to get linting directly in the code. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint.
- To get the right indentation, etc. directly in the code, and on save add the Prettier extension to VS Code. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode. 
- To get VS Code to automatically fix linting errors (if possible) and organize imports on save, add the following to your settings.json file:

        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": [
          "source.organizeImports",
          "source.fixAll.eslint"
        ],
